# Parca Agent

Parca Agent is an always-on sampling profiler that uses eBPF to capture raw profiling data with very low overhead. It observes user-space and kernel-space stacktraces [19 times per second](docs/design.md#cpu-sampling-frequency) and builds [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) formatted profiles from the extracted data. Read more details in the [design documentation](docs/design.md).

The collected data can be viewed locally via HTTP endpoints and then be configured to be sent to a [Parca](https://github.com/parca-dev/parca) server to be queried and analyzed over time.

## Requirements

- Linux Kernel version 5.3+ with BTF

## Quickstart

See the [Kubernetes Getting Started](https://www.parca.dev/docs/kubernetes).

## Language Support

Parca Agent is continuously enhancing its support for multiple languages.
Incomplete list of languages we currently support:

- C, C++, Go (with extended support), Rust
- .NET, Deno, Erlang, Java, Julia, Node.js, Wasmtime, PHP 8 and above
- Ruby, Python

Please check [our docs](https://www.parca.dev/docs/parca-agent-language-support) for further information.

> [!NOTE]
> [Further language support](https://github.com/parca-dev/parca-agent/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature%2Flanguage-support) is coming in the upcoming weeks and months.

## Supported Profiles

Types of profiles that are available:

- On-CPU
- Soon: Network usage, Allocations

> [!NOTE]
> Please check [our docs](https://www.parca.dev/docs/parca-agent-language-support) if your language is supported.

The following types of profiles require explicit instrumentation:

- Runtime specific information such as Goroutines

## Debugging

### Logging

To debug potential errors, enable debug logging using `--log-level=debug`.

## Metadata Labels

Parca Agent supports [Prometheus relabeling](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config). The following labels are always attached to profiles:

* `node`: The name of the node that the process is running on as specified by the `--node` flag.
* `comm`: The command name of the process being profiled.

And optionally you can attach additional labels using the `--metadata-external-labels` flag.

Using relabeling the following labels can be attached to profiles:

* `__meta_process_pid`: The process ID of the process being profiled.
* `__meta_process_cmdline`: The command line arguments of the process being profiled.
* `__meta_process_cgroup`: The (main) cgroup of the process being profiled.

* `__meta_process_executable_build_id`: The build ID of the executable of the process being profiled.
* `__meta_process_executable_compiler`: The compiler used to build the executable of the process being profiled.
* `__meta_process_executable_static`: Whether the executable of the process being profiled is statically linked.
* `__meta_process_executable_stripped`: Whether the executable of the process being profiled is stripped from debuginfo.
* `__meta_system_kernel_release`: The kernel release of the system.
* `__meta_system_kernel_machine`: The kernel machine of the system (typically the architecture).
* `__meta_thread_comm`: The command name of the thread being profiled.
* `__meta_thread_id`: The PID of the thread being profiled.
* `__meta_agent_revision`: The revision of the agent.

* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_uid`: The UID of the pod the process is running in.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_controller_kind`: The kind of the controller of the pod the process is running in.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_controller_name`: The name of the controller of the pod the process is running in.
* `__meta_kubernetes_node_label_*`: The value of the label `*` of the node the process is running on.

## Security

Parca Agent is required to be running as `root` user (or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`). Various security precautions have been taken to protect users running Parca Agent. See details in [Security Considerations](./docs/security.md).

To report a security vulnerability, see [this guide](./docs/security.md#Report-Security-Vulnerabilities).
