If you wish to do any changes, it's preferable to do that via the interface file. Note that we're suppressing the memory leaks related warnings as they're false positives. But make sure to always check with `make build-dyn ENABLE_ASAN=yes` before adding any new users of this package to avoid the potential leaks.
